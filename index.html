      2. Header Section

      I'm using <header> and <nav> to define the top part of the page, 
      just like the assignment said: create a clearly defined header and navigation area.

          4. Recipe Article (included as a complete content section)

          I used <article> to wrap the whole recipe, following the requirement

              Ingredients list

              I used an unordered list here because the order of items doesn’t matter,
              which aligns with semantic HTML5 use, as mentioned in our Class.
            -->
            <section>
                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>

                    <li>1 cup tomato and pepper blend</li>

              Step-by-step instructions

              I used <ol> here because the steps must be followed in a specific order.
              This helps both users and screen readers follow the flow correctly.

            <section>
                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat oil and sauté chopped onions.</li>
                    <li>Add the tomato-pepper mix and cook until the oil separates.</li>

          5. Extra Info with <aside>

          I used <aside> to show supporting information that’s not part of the main recipe.
          This is what I think the assignment suggests for semantic structure.
        -->
        <aside id="chef-tip" aria-labelledby="tip-heading">
            <h3 id="tip-heading">Chef's Tip</h3>
            <p>To get that classic smoky "party rice" flavor, let the rice burn slightly at the bottom of the pot before turning off the heat.</p>

    <!-- 
      6. Footer Section

      This section wraps up the page with author info and a link to my portfolio,
      just like the assignment says to include meaningful footer content.
